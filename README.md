Instructions

Write a program that performs an HTTP GET request to get the average stock price. Use the first argument for a ticker symbol. Use the get method in the http module with the API provided by MarkitOnDemand.

It would certainly be easier to test if you can grab the latest stock price, but because the response is so small, there may not be an opportunity to demonstrate chunking. On the API docs you will see an example request for data to create a chart. This will give 365 of daily prices. Use these prices to get an average.

Expected:

$ ./stocks.js AAPL
$123.45
Bonus

Avoid using encoded characters in your url: %22%3A%5B%22c%22%5D%7D%5D%7D
Full Destructuring on the API response object and http module
Abstract a getJSON function. (This is good practice for when we write our own APIs):
